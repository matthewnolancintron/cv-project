Components/sections
should have edit/submit button
or the whole cv should have a edit/submit button

submit button shuld submit form and display value of
input fields in HTML element.

edit button should display input fields
with previously dispalyed info as values
should be able to edit and resubmit content from
input fields.

complete this using state and props.

plan:
option 1:
    could turn app into a single form

option 2:
    each section/component into it's own form


option 1:
methods would need to update more of state
each time the user edits the cv,
edit submit button would live in app,
and app would be a single form composed of component sections

option 2:
each component/section would be a form,
edit/submit button would live on each component,

I'll try option 2.
